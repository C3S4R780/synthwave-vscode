    <h1>Synthwave has changed</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/raw/master/banner.png" alt="Synthwave '84 logo over a cityscape" style="max-width:100%;">
    <p>It's been a wild ride since I first tweeted about Synthwave '84. The support has been amazing and I'd like to say thanks everyone who has shared or used the theme over the last release. I'd particularly like to thank you all for battling through the <i>less than ideal</i> installation process. It's been a bumpy road but it's been truly great to see so many people enjoying the theme.</p>
    <p>Thank you all 🙏</p>

    <h2>Neon Dreams</h2>
    <p>This v0.1.0 update marks a changing point for the theme. Recent Updates to VS code broke compatibility with the CSS needed to enable the glow and it had become clear that a more maintainable and long-term solution would be needed.</p>
    <p>This new update, called Neon Dreams, removes the need to use the <i>Custom CSS and JS</i> extension to enable the glow. It also rethinks how to apply the glow, so it should cope better with updates to VS code.</p>

    <h2>Before using</h2>
    <p>If you have been using Synthwave prior to v0.1.0, you will likely have used the Custom CSS and JS extension to enable the glow. Before enabling Neon Dreams, you will need to disable the prior method.</p>
    <p>You can do this by pressing <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code> or <code>Shift + ⌘ + P</code> and choose "<b>Disable Custom CSS and JS</b>"</p>
    
    <h2>Start dreaming</h2>
    <p>Firstly, if you are a Windows or Linux user, you may need to run VS Code as an administrator in order to enable Neon Dreams.</p>
    <p>Once you have admin permissions, open VS Code, press <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code> or <code>Shift + ⌘ + P</code> and choose "<b>Enable Neon Dreams</b>"</p>
    <p>You should be prompted for a restart. When the editor reloads, the glow should be active.</p>
    <p>As with the prior versions, VS Code may warn you that your installation is corrupt. You can suppress this message by choosing 'Don't show this again' from the notification.</p>
    <p>Also as before, whenever VS code updates, you will need to rerun the enable command</p>

    <h2>To customise the glow brightness</h2>
    <p>In your `settings.json` add the key: <code>"synthwave84.brightness": "0.45"</code></p>
    <p>The value should be a _float value_ from 0 to 1, where 00 is fully transparent. The default brightness is 0.45. To avoid eye strain, avoid using higher brightness values for extended periods of time.</p>
    <p><b>To see the changes in your editor, rerun the "Enable Neon Dreams" command.</b></p>

    <h2>To enable editor chrome updates, but disable glow</h2>
    <p>In your `settings.json` add the key: <code>"synthwave84.disableGlow": true</code></p>
    <p><b>To see the changes in your editor, rerun the "Enable Neon Dreams" command.</b></p>
